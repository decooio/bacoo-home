    "desc1": "Profit Data, an event recently launched by Crust Network, encourages users to use Crust to store files and accordingly share a reward pool of 54,000 CRUs. The more files you store in Crust, the more CRUs you can get in return. Although the rewards are generous, some barriers to this event discourage many participants: managing CRU accounts, using IPFS, staking CSM tokens, and even setting up ordering strategies in Crust. Here is a simple solution: Decoo. Sign up, log in and begin to store your files in Decoo and let Decoo do the rest for you.",
    "desc2": "Profit Data is the event recently initiated by Crust, the network that acts as the very foundation of a decentralized cloud storage. The event is believed to be closely in align with one of the core philosophies of Web 3.0, that is, to let web users take back the ownership of their data and more importantly the value generated by the data.",
    "desc3": "During the event, users are incentivized to store their data by Crust and stake CSM tokens to become ‘Data Providers’ in the decentralized web. Crust offers up to 54,000 CRUs to all of the Data Providers according to their Data Power.",
    "desc4": "Decoo is by the nature a significant player in this Profit Data event, because technically Decoo leverages IPFS and Crust to construct its distributed cloud storage service. All the data provided by Decoo users will be managed as a whole to generate a huge Data Power value, so that Decoo users don’t need to know all the details. Just sign up, choose a plan and store. That’s all you need to do.",
    "How the reward will be distributed": "How the reward will be distributed",
    "desc5": " The principle is simple: Decoo will manage all the storage orders generated by its storage demands and optimize the ‘profit’ with its scale advantage and technical advantage. Decoo plans to distribute the ‘profit’ on a periodical basis to the user according to their effective storage usage (data size). To receive the ‘profit’, you will be asked to claim your CRU account in your Decoo User Panel after registration. More information will be released in the near future",
